    "<h2>Introduction</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "The main purpose of this work is to learn <font color='orange'>**embeddings**</font>. Embeddings can be considered as a representation of a document in a space (called **embedding space**) where similar documents should be very close to each other. Therefore to guide our comprehension of what are embeddings, we will build a recommendation system based on books in wikipedia. The principle is as follow: \"<u>*books with Wikipedia pages that link to similar Wikipedia pages are similar to each other*</u>\". Ex: Book1 <-- link2; Book3 <-- link2 => Book1 and Book3 are similar. So, to exhibit this similarity, we will use neural network entity embeddings, mapping each book and each Wikipedia link (Wikilink) to a 50-number vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "Embeddings have demonstrated some advantages in representing categorical variables: \n",
    "1. They help in reducing the original space where documents are expressed. In our case for example, if we were using *one-hot-encoding* method to representing books, we would have 3.7e+06 length vector for each book. \n",
    "2. They preserve similarity in terms of semantic meaning of each document (the books in our case) that is not the case of *one-hot-encoding* where semantic meaning of document is not preserved. By training a neural network to learn entity embeddings, we not only get a reduced dimension representation of the books, we also get a representation that keeps similar books (in terms of what they talk about) closer to each other. Basic approach for a recommendation system is to find the closest books for any book in other to recommend to a user books that may have same content like those he/she already read. Thanks to [this notebook](1-Downloading%20and%20Parsing%20Wikipedia%20Articles.ipynb), we have access to every single book article on Wikipedia, which will let us create an effective recommendation system."

    "To create entity embeddings, we need to <u>build an **embedding neural network**</u> and train it <u>on a **supervised machine learning task**</u> that will <u>result in **similar books** (and similar links) having closer representations</u> in embedding space. <font color='orange'>The parameters of the neural network - the weights - are the embeddings</font>, and so during training, these numbers are adjusted to minimize the loss on the prediction problem. In other words, the network tries to accurately complete the task by changing the representations of the books and the links.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have the embeddings for the books and the links, we can find the most similar book to a given book by computing the distance between the embedded vector for that book and all the other book embeddings. <u>We'll use the **cosine distance**</u> which measures the angle between two vectors as a measure of similarity (another valid option is the Euclidean distance). We can also do the same with the links, finding the most similar page to a given page. (I use links and wikilinks interchangeably in this notebook). The steps we will follow are:\n",

    "<h2>Neural Network Embeddings for better representing large sequence of texts</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural Network embeddings have proven to be very powerful concepts both for modeling language and for representing categorical variables.  For example, the [Word2Vec](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/text/word2vec?hl=fr) word embeddings by Google, map a word to a vector based on training a neural network on millions of words. These embeddings can be used in any supervised model because they are just numerical representations of categorical variables. Much as we one-hot-encode categorical variables to use them in a random forest for a supervised task, we can also use entity embeddings to include categorical variables in a model. The embeddings are also useful because we can find entities that are close to one another in embedding space which might - as in a book recommendation system - allow us to find the most similar categories among tens of thousands of choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also use the Entity Embeddings to visualize words or categorical variables, such as creating a map of all books on Wikipedia. The entity embeddings typically are still high-dimensional - we'll use 50 numbers for each entity - so we need to use a dimension reduction technique such as [TSNE](https://distill.pub/2016/misread-tsne/) or [UMAP](https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how_umap_works.html) to visualize the embeddings in lower dimensions. (These are both manifold embedding methods so in effect we will embed the embeddings for visualization!) We'll take a look at doing this at the end of the notebook and later will upload the embeddings into a application custom-built for this purpose ([projector.tensorflow.org](https://projector.tensorflow.org/)). Entity embeddings are becoming more widespread thanks to the ease of development of neural networks in Keras and are a useful approach when we want to represent categorical variables with vectors that place similar categories close to one another. Other approaches for encoding categorical variables do not represent similar entities as being closer to one another, and entity embedding is a learning-based method for this important task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this project is a great look at the potential for neural networks to create meaningful embeddings of high dimensional data and a practical application of deep learning. The code itself is relatively simple, and the Keras library makes developing deep learning models enjoyable!\n",
    "\n",
    "The code here is adapted from the excellent [Deep Learning Cookbook](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Cookbook-Practical-Recipes/dp/149199584X), the notebooks for which can be found on [this GitHub repository]((https://github.com/DOsinga/deep_learning_cookbook/tree/master)).

    "As we said before, to compute the embeddings, we are not going to create a separate validation or testing set. While this is a **must** for a normal supervised machine learning task, in this case, our primary objective is not to make the most accurate model, but to generate the best embeddings. The prediction task is just the method through which we train our network to make the embeddings. At the end of training, we are not going to be testing our model on new data, so we don't need to evaluate the performance. Instead of testing on new data, we'll look at the embeddings themselves to see if books that we think are similar have embeddings that are close to each other.\n",

    "If we kept a separate validation / testing set, then we would be limiting the amount of data that our network can use to train. This would result in less accurate embeddings. Normally with any supervised model, we need to be concerned about overfitting, but again, because we do not need our model to generalize to new data and our goal is the embeddings, we will make our model as effective as possible by using all the data for training. In general, always have a separate validation and testing set (or use cross validation) and make sure to regularize your model to prevent overfitting."

In regression, our labels are either -1 or 1, and so the model loss function will be mean squared error in order to minimize the distance between the prediction and the output. Using the dot product with normalization means that the `Dot` layer is finding the cosine similarity between the embedding for the book and the link.
